index fund which jack market indexes data subject to market risk however investors should understand unsystematic risk is not necessary really matters because it can help fund managers gives superior returns over a sufficiently long investment horizon great advice for investors you should invest according to your risk appetite and investment needs without worrying about is it safe to invest in mutual funds now or not liquidity risk this can arise due to inability of the fund manager to sell the underlying securities of scheme when the need arises that is redemption pressures if there are not sufficient buyers due to prevailing market conditions example very high volatility beer market etc a foreign manager may be unable to sell securities in extreme market conditions the mc may stop
